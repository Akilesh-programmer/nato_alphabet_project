Many times when we spell our name or any other importnat stuff to other person, there are many chances for them to misunderstand the word. So that we spell them with NATO alphabet.
For example in "Akilesh", you can as Alpha for a.
Like this we have NATO alphabets for every word.
In this program, we will get hold of any one's name and then we will be giving them the NATO formatting for them. So that they don't wanna go through the painful process by themselves.
There are two files in thie project. First we have the main.py file, this file consists of the main execution code. Next we have nato_phonetic_aplhabet.csv file, it is a csv file. It contains the NATO alphabets. We will extracting it to main.py and we will be using it.
